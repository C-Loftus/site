Iâ€™m a visually impaired computer programmer, web developer, open source advocate, hardware enthusiast, video editor,
and, above all, just a complete nerd.

I got involved with this project because I'm a huge proponent of [free,
libre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software), [open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software)
software. Developing the software that runs our lives out in the open increases security, encourages innovation,
prevents monopolistic practices and above all, makes technology accessible to everyone, which is the primary goal of the
Odilia screen reader project.
