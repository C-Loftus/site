I got involved with Odilia basically by accident.
I didn't use a screenreader on Linux because the existing options were slow on my PinebookPro and Raspberry Pi.

When I heard about a possible new screenreader for Linux, written in Rust (a language I always wanted an excuse to learn about), I joined the Discord channel just to *observe* and *comment*.
Within a month I started contributing.
I've learned a ton from the others involved in the project, especially [FakeVIP](/authors/thefake-vip/).

I dedicate (almost) every Saturday to the development of Odilia.
