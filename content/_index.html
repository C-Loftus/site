<h1>Welcome to Odilia!</h1>

<p>Accessibility on Linux has historically been under-developed,
under-maintained, and therefore not up to modern standards for many blind
people. We’re hear to help with that!</p>

<p>Odilia is a new screen reader for the Linux desktop. It’s written in <a
href="https://rust-lang.org">Rust</a>, for maximum performance and
stability.</p>

<p> On top of what screen reading features we already have on Linux, we intend to add roughly the following:</p>

<div class="features">
    <div class="feature">
        <h2>Addons</h2>
        <p> You're no longer limited to built-in functionality! Install addons
        from third-party developers to extend Odilia with new commands and
        abilities. Or, if you're a developer, write your own in one of several
        languages.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="feature">
        <h2>Object Nav</h2>
        <p>Navigate applications as a tree of accessible objects, making it
        easy to interact with parts of the interface that are partly inaccessible, don't play well with keyboard focus, or
        are hard to use, no mouse required!</p>
    </div>
    <div class="feature">
        <h2>OCR</h2>
        <p>Use optical character recognition to read text in images or
        inaccessible apps, and activate the buttons you need.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="feature">
        <h2>Touch Support</h2>
        <p>Use Odilia on your Linux smartphone, tablet, or touch-screen equipped laptop.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="feature">
        <h2>Customisable Input</h2>
        <p>Configure any keyboard shortcut, mouse button or touch gesture to
        activate any Odilia command, even those provided by addons! You can
        customise any default keybinding, either directly in the config file
        with a text editor, or in an intuative graphical application.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<p>And hopefully many more!</p>

<h2>Why the Name?</h2>

<p>Odilia, also known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odile_of_Alsace">Odile of Alsace</a>, is the patron
saint of the blind, partially sighted, and good eye sight in the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church">Catholic</a> and <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Orthodox_Church">Eastern Orthodox</a> churches. We hope that we can, in a
sense, return the lost sense of sight to blind Linux desktop users, and make using their computer easier and more
fun!</p>

<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: Even in the Odilia development team, we have people with different religions, cathlic,
orthodox, even atheists, so we in no way picked the name of Odilia to spite anyone, specifically because it belongs to
any religion, neither do we imply by it that one religion is better than another. We simply believe that strong names
are also of value, that's why we chose something that had some symbolism behind it.</p>

<p>In its earliest stages of development, this project was called <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yggdrasil">Yggdrasil</a>, associating the mythical descriptions of the tree with
how accessibility should unify the world. Though we changed it later because of community feedback, we want to emphasize
that we always have been interested in names with strong symbolism behind them.</p>
