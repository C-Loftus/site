Odilia should start speaking immediately when started.

Some things may feel different.

## What Works

* Caret navigation.
* Tab navigation.
* `aria-live` regions on a web page will speak in real time.

## What Doesn't Work

* Terminals -- Odilia will read the entire buffer, not just the new lines.
* Key bindings
* Structural navigation
