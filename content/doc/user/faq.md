## Why don't you support keybindings?

Currently, key bindings are very hard to register across arbitrary desktop environments.
We will be working on this for the next release.

## How do I change my speech rate?

Your speech rate must be changed in your speech dispatcher settings.
This is often in a file called `speechd.conf` either in your `$XDG_HOME` directory, or in `/etc/speech-dispatcher/`.
The value you want to change is `DefaultRate`.
It accepts a value between 0 and 100.

## How Can I Help?

As a user, there are two best things you can do:

1. Open new issues when there are features missing or broken [on our Github page](https://github.com/odilia-app/odilia/issues).
2. Donate a small fraction of your monthly budget to help us move away from our current jobs, to write software for you. We do this because we love accessibility, and we love free software; but, without external support we can only work on this in our free time.
