After many months of hard work, we are proud to announce the initial, beta release of Odilia:
a new, *fast*, lightweight, screenreader for Linux.
Thanks to all the others on the team: BGT Lover, and FakeVIP who have been instrumental in creating this project.

Don't get us wrong, this is still in its initial stages.
However, there is enough functionality to use it, and we want to get it out into the hands of other developers and testers to make this even better for the beta 2 release (0.2), which we're aiming to complete by the end of this year (December 2022).
**Things will break.**
Please help us make this better so that we can create the next generation of accessible software for Linux.

Here is a quick list of what Odilia is capable of as of today:

* Reading web pages
* Limited structural navigation
* Reading GTK and QT applications
* Configurable voices/rate via `speechd.conf`.

Here is a small list of things which Odilia does not yet currently do, which we are slating for the 0.2 release later this year:

* More advanced structural navigation
* Change voice settings from within Odilia

And here is a short roadmap of what we want to complete before an official, non-testing release sometime in 2023:

* Automated cache updates
* Stability improvements
* Addon support

We encourage those curious about new tech to [download Odilia](/doc/user/installation/) and give it a fair shake.
We're looking forward to making this with you all!
