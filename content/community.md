The Odilia dev team regularly hangs out in our Matrix space: [#odilia-screen-reader:matrix.org][matrix-space]. Whether
you have plans to contribute, want to follow along with development, or just want some fellow nerds to chat to, come
join us! We also bridge this space to [discord][discord-invite], and you can [get in touch with the developers
directly]({{< relref "authors" >}}) if you wish.

## Contributing

There are many ways you can contribute to Odilia.

1. If you're a developer, send us a pull-request. Help us make Odilia better by fixing an [outstanding issue](https://github.com/odilia-app/odilia/issues/).
2. If you're a user, [install Odilia](/doc/user/installation/), and *report your bugs and feature requests to us* [on Github](https://github.com/odilia-app/odilia/issues/).
3. If you believe in our cause, consider donating to one of us, as we continue to develop this project. It allows us to spend more time on Odilia, and less time at work.
