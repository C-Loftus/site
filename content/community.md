The Odilia dev team regularly hangs out in our Matrix space: [#odilia-screen-reader:matrix.org][matrix-space]. Whether
you have plans to contribute, want to follow along with development, or just want some fellow nerds to chat to, come
join us! We also bridge this space to [discord][discord-invite], and you can [get in touch with the developers
directly]({{< relref "authors" >}}) if you wish.

## Contributing

This is a very young project, we appreciate any and all contributions! However, please be aware there is a very llarge
learning curve to helping with this project, particularly due to the lack of documentation, or **complete**
documentation, of many of the libraries and technologies that comprise the Linux accessibility stack. For this reason,
we are currently focused on learning as much as we can, and writing code to take advantage of it, and we don't have lots
of time to mentor new contributors or review pull requests.

Once the ground-work has been layed, accepting contributions should get much easier. We are greatful for your
cooperation in this regard!
