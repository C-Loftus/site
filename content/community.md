The Odilia dev team regularly hangs out in our Matrix space: [#odilia-screen-reader:matrix.org][matrix-space]. Whether
you have plans to contribute, want to follow along with development, or just want some fellow nerds to chat to, come
join us! We also bridge this space to [discord][discord-invite], and you can [get in touch with the developers
directly]({{< relref "authors" >}}) if you wish.

[matrix-space]: <https://matrix.to/#/#odilia-screen-reader:matrix.org>

## Contributing

We are so excited to already have some great contributors for the Odilia project and some of its associated libraries.
Please, [open a Github issue](https://github.com/odilia-app/odilia/issues/), or send us a patch so we can make Odilia the best open-source screen reader!
Our community makes us who we are.
We can't wait for you to join us!
